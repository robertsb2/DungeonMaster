Long ago a mysterious dungeon appeared just outside the city of Durnwell. Monsters poured out and ravaged the countryside... The once prosperous
 city was reduced to a fraction of it's former glory. Over time, the attacks diminished, but an evil force could still be felt looming
 over the land. The people of Durnwell were never able to fully recover, and even now generations later, most are still too poor to
 escape from under the shadow of the tower. All they can do is hope that one day, a hero will come and rid the land of the tower's
 evil influence. Fate has chosen you to be that hero.
