You've arrived on the outskirts of Durnwell and have set up camp halfway between the town and the dungeon.
 From here you can either head into town to prepare, or head straight for the dungeon. Whatever you choose, beware,
 for legend says that the dungeon is different every time someone tries to enter it.
